- Using a random seed for training and test sets, instead of training images which might take a long time. Inputs consist of 2 features,
first layer consist of 4 neurons and the activation of this layer is relu function, and output layer consist of 1 neuron and the activation of
this layer is 
sigmoid, if the prediction with bigger than half so it’s a cat if it’s not it’s a dog for example, this is what the example is speaking about.
- We comment the part of the data preparation for deep neural network learning, so it doesn’t affect the code, and we used a random
seed with simple neuron network consist of 2 layers
- With this random seed of the data set the training accuracy was 75 %
