Apply reinforcement learning to automatically design a policy for difficult control task, without ever using any explicit knowledge of the
dynamics of the underlying system.
- By initializing random values for transition probabilities, transition counts, reward count, reward, and value, and depending on this
initialization the algorithm will take an action and we let it fails sometimes to learn, and then we update the initialization and we will use
value iteration algorithm to update the value
- Our objective is to develop a controller to balance the pole with these constraints, by 
appropriately having the cart accelerate left and right.
